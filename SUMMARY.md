# BSSC Testnet - Current Status & Summary

## ✅ What's Working RIGHT NOW:

### 1. Your Live Endpoints:
- **Website**: https://bssc.live ✅
- **RPC**: https://bssc-rpc.bssc.live ✅
- **Status**: All online and functional

### 2. Current Chain ID Issue:
- **Local File**: Shows Chain ID 47964 (0xBB5C) ✅
- **Render Deployment**: Still showing 56 (BSC) ❌
- **Problem**: Render isn't picking up the git changes

## 🔧 Chain ID Options:

### Option A: Use Chain ID 97 (BSC Testnet)
```
Chain ID: 97
Network: BSSC Testnet  
```
**Pros**: 
- BSC testnet's official ID
- Users know it's a test network
- No conflicts

### Option B: Use Chain ID 47964 (Custom BSSC)
```
Chain ID: 47964 (0xBB5C)
Network: BSSC Testnet
```
**Pros**:
- Unique to BSSC
- No conflicts
- Professional

**Cons**:
- Render deployment issue (need to fix)

### Option C: Use Chain ID 9000-9999 (Common for testnets)
```
Chain ID: 9056
Network: BSSC Testnet
```
**Pros**:
- Easy to remember (9056 = 9 + 056)
- Common testnet range
- No conflicts

## 💡 Quick Fix - Let's Use Chain ID 97:

This is BSC Testnet's chain ID. Since you're BSSC (like BSC but on Solana), using 97 for testnet makes perfect sense!

**MetaMask will accept it immediately** - no warnings!

## 📊 What You Have:

1. ✅ Working RPC server on Render
2. ✅ Working website
3. ✅ EVM transaction handling
4. ✅ Faucet functionality
5. ✅ MetaMask test page
6. ✅ All documentation

## 🎯 Recommendation:

**Use Chain ID 97 for your testnet**

It's:
- Clean (no conflicts)
- Professional (BSC testnet standard)
- Immediately works in MetaMask
- Users understand it's a testnet
