# BSSC RPC Server - 100% REAL (NO MOCK) Implementation

## What Was Removed ❌

### Mock Data Stores
- ✅ `transactionStore` - was storing fake transactions
- ✅ `receiptStore` - was storing fake receipts  
- ✅ `bnbBalances` - was tracking fake BNB balances
- ✅ `ethAddressBalances` - was tracking fake ETH address balances
- ✅ `solanaAddressBalances` - was tracking fake Solana balances
- ✅ `addressNonces` - was tracking fake transaction counts
- ✅ `transactionTimestamps` - was tracking fake timestamps
- ✅ `currentBlockNumber` / `currentBlockHash` - was generating fake blocks
- ✅ ALL `mockResponses` object removed

### Mock Methods Removed
- ❌ `getBNBBalance` - no longer exists
- ❌ `transferBNB` - no longer exists  
- ❌ `getBNBTokenInfo` - no longer exists
- ❌ `requestBNBAirdrop` - no longer exists
- ❌ `bssc_getAllTransactions` - no longer exists
- ❌ `bssc_getRecentTransactions` - no longer exists
- ❌ `getAllTransactions()` function - removed
- ❌ `getRecentTransactions()` function - removed
- ❌ `generateTxHash()` - removed
- ❌ `generateBlockHash()` - removed
- ❌ `createMockReceipt()` - removed
- ❌ `createMockTransaction()` - removed

## What's Now REAL ✅

### Real Faucet (`eth_requestFaucet`)
- Calls real `requestAirdrop` on BSSC validator
- Converts ETH address → Solana address
- Gets real Solana signature back
- Updates real blockchain balance
- NO fallback - fails if validator not available

### Real Balance Queries (`eth_getBalance`)
- Calls real `getBalance` on BSSC validator
- Converts ETH address → Solana address
- Returns actual blockchain balance in wei/hex format
- NO in-memory cache - always queries validator

### Address Mapping System
- Maps ETH addresses to Solana addresses deterministically
- Stores mappings to `bssc-data.json` for persistence
- Caches Solana signatures for ETH tx hash lookups

## Methods That Still Need Implementation 🚧

These methods currently reference variables that no longer exist:

1. **`eth_getTransactionCount`** - needs to query real validator
2. **`eth_sendTransaction`** - needs to send real Solana transaction
3. **`eth_sendRawTransaction`** - needs to parse and send real tx
4. **`eth_getTransactionByHash`** - needs to query real validator
5. **`eth_getTransactionReceipt`** - needs to query real validator confirmation
6. **`eth_getLogs`** - needs to query real validator logs
7. **`eth_getBlockByNumber`** - needs to query real validator blocks

## Required: BSSC Validator Must Be Running

**CRITICAL:** This RPC server now REQUIRES a running BSSC validator at:
- Default: `http://127.0.0.1:8899`
- Or set: `BSSC_VALIDATOR_URL=http://your-validator:8899`

### Start Your Validator:
```bash
solana-test-validator --no-bpf-jit \\
    --bind-address 0.0.0.0 \\
    --rpc-port 8899 \\
    --faucet-port 9900 \\
    --ledger test-ledger
```

## Testing Real Faucet

```bash
# 1. Start validator
solana-test-validator

# 2. Start RPC server  
node bssc-live-server.js

# 3. Request tokens from explorer or curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_requestFaucet","params":["0xYourEthAddress"]}'

# 4. Check balance:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xYourEthAddress","latest"]}'
```

## Next Steps

You now have a foundation with:
- ✅ Real faucet
- ✅ Real balance queries  
- ✅ ETH ↔ Solana address mapping
- ✅ Validator connection checking

Still needed for full MetaMask support:
- 🚧 Real transaction submission (`eth_sendTransaction`, `eth_sendRawTransaction`)
- 🚧 Real transaction queries (`eth_getTransactionByHash`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`)
- 🚧 Real block queries (`eth_getBlockByNumber`)
- 🚧 Real nonce tracking (`eth_getTransactionCount`)
- 🚧 Real event logs (`eth_getLogs`)

Would you like me to implement the remaining real methods?
