# Week 1 Progress Report: BSSC Token Integration

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated package.json
**Added:**
- `@solana/spl-token` dependency for SPL token support

**Location:** `package.json`

### 2. Added BSSC Token Configuration
**Added to:** `bssc-live-server.js`

**Configuration:**
```javascript
const BSSC_TOKEN_CONFIG = {
    mint: 'EBoXrDiJe363nGrHQoBUN2k2GJzQs11N7kUqUUNVpump',
    symbol: 'BSSC',
    name: 'Binance Super Smart Chain',
    decimals: 6,
    totalSupply: 954000000,
    gasFees: {
        transfer: 0.001,
        contractCall: 0.01,
        contractDeploy: 10,
        nftMint: 0.1,
        staking: 1000
    },
    feeDistribution: {
        burn: 50,
        validators: 50
    }
};
```

### 3. Implemented Helper Functions

**Three new functions added:**

#### `checkBSSCBalance(solanaAddress, connection)`
- Checks if user has enough BSSC tokens for gas fees
- Returns true/false
- Logs balance information
- Gracefully handles errors

#### `deductBSSCGasFee(fromAddress, connection, operationType)`
- Creates transfer instruction for gas fee
- Supports different operation types (transfer, contractCall, etc.)
- Returns instruction or null if disabled
- Uses fee collector address

#### `burnBSSC(amount)`
- Placeholder for burn mechanism
- Will be implemented when burn authority is configured
- Logs burn actions

### 4. Integrated into Transaction Flow

**Before transaction is sent:**
1. Check BSSC balance
2. If insufficient, throw error with helpful message
3. Create gas fee instruction
4. Add to transaction
5. Execute transfer

**Code changes:**
- Added balance check before building transaction
- Added gas fee instruction to transaction
- Error message includes pump.fun link to buy BSSC

## Testing Needed

### Before Mainnet:
1. Install SPL token package: `npm install @solana/spl-token`
2. Set environment variable: `FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS`
3. Test balance checking with actual BSSC tokens
4. Test transaction with/without BSSC balance
5. Verify gas fee deduction works correctly
6. Test error handling for insufficient balance

### Test Cases:
```javascript
// Test 1: User with sufficient BSSC
- Should allow transaction
- Should deduct gas fee
- Should execute transfer

// Test 2: User without BSSC
- Should reject transaction
- Should show error message
- Should provide link to buy BSSC

// Test 3: Library not available
- Should allow transaction (backwards compatibility)
- Should log warning

// Test 4: Fee collector not configured
- Should skip gas fee deduction
- Should allow transaction
```

## Next Steps

### This Week:
1. Install and test `@solana/spl-token` package
2. Set up fee collector address
3. Test with real BSSC tokens on local testnet
4. Fix any bugs discovered

### Next Week:
1. Deploy to production validator
2. Configure fee collector on mainnet
3. Enable monitoring for BSSC usage
4. Update explorer to show BSSC stats

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Added SPL token dependency
2. `bssc-live-server.js` - Added token integration code (~150 lines)

## Impact

### User Experience:
- Users need BSSC tokens to send transactions
- Error messages guide users to buy BSSC
- Gas fees in BSSC instead of SOL

### Token Economics:
- Creates constant demand for BSSC
- Fees collected for validators/staking
- Burn mechanism reduces supply

### Developer:
- Backwards compatible (graceful degradation)
- Easy to enable/disable features
- Configurable through environment variables

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
- `FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS` - Address to receive gas fees
- `BSSC_VALIDATOR_URL` - Validator RPC URL (default: localhost:8899)

### Optional Settings:
- Gas fee amounts (configurable in BSSC_TOKEN_CONFIG)
- Fee distribution percentages
- Operation-specific fees

## Security Considerations

### Implemented:
- Balance checking before transaction
- Error handling for missing libraries
- Graceful degradation for backwards compatibility

### Needed:
- Rate limiting for balance checks
- Fee collector address validation
- Protection against fee collector attacks

## Performance

### Optimization:
- Balance check happens before transaction building
- Early failure saves resources
- Gas fee instruction created only if needed

### Monitoring Points:
- BSSC balance check failures
- Gas fee deduction success rate
- Transaction rejection rate
- Average BSSC balance

## Notes

- Code is production-ready but needs testing
- SPL token library needs to be installed
- Fee collector address needs to be configured
- Backwards compatible (won't break existing functionality)
